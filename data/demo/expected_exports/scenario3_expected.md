# Demo Project – Insight Report (Scenario 3: Sleep Support)

## Themes
1. **Daytime Anchors** – Morning light and caffeine timing shape nighttime sleep quality. _(confidence 0.75)_
   - Claim: Morning light exposure helps anchor the circadian rhythm. [^1]
   - Claim: Avoiding caffeine after mid-afternoon can reduce nighttime disturbances. [^2]

2. **Short Nap Strategy** – 10–20 minute power naps reduce sleep pressure without significant sleep inertia. _(confidence 0.72)_
   - Claim: Short naps aid alertness without grogginess when kept under ~20 minutes. [^3]
   - Claim: Consistent pre-sleep routine and 18–20°C room temp improve sleep quality. [^4]

## Decision: Adopt Light + Nap Protocol
- Rationale: Low-cost interventions with measurable benefits for alertness and sleep continuity.
- Pros: Easy to trial; compatible with newborn care schedule; evidence-backed.
- Cons: Requires discipline; environmental constraints (light/temp).
- Risk: Overreliance on naps; schedule drift.
- Confidence: 0.71
- Next Actions:
  - [ ] Morning 10–15 min light exposure.
  - [ ] No caffeine after 2pm.
  - [ ] Keep naps ≤20 mins.
  - [ ] Set bedroom temp ~19°C where feasible.
